Collective cellular migration has been widely observed in embryonic development, wound healing and tumour invasion. From the perspectives of both biophysics and signalling, collective cellular migration and the associated issues of packing geometry and cell jamming and unjamming on two-dimensional (2D) flat surfaces have been widely explored. For example, epithelial cells growing on flat substrates approach a jamming transition during maturation, exhibiting an increasing velocity correlation length9, decreasing cell speed and decreasing cell aspect ratio. In contrast, most biological structures, such as alveoli, bronchi and intestines, are naturally curved in three dimensions. Even for inert materials, it is known that curvature fundamentally changes basic processes such as crystallization, yet it remains unclear to what extent the cellular collective responds to curvature.
