Here are some projects that I am working on.

Collective curvature sensing in 3D multicellular systems
======
Collective cellular migration has been widely observed in embryonic development, wound healing and tumour invasion. From the perspectives of both biophysics and signalling, collective cellular migration and the associated issues of packing geometry and cell jamming and unjamming on two-dimensional (2D) flat surfaces have been widely explored. For example, epithelial cells growing on flat substrates approach a jamming transition during maturation, exhibiting an increasing velocity correlation length, decreasing cell speed and decreasing cell aspect ratio. In contrast, most biological structures, such as alveoli, bronchi and intestines, are naturally curved in three dimensions. Even for inert materials, it is known that curvature fundamentally changes basic processes such as crystallization, yet it remains unclear to what extent the cellular collective responds to curvature.


Cell packing and self-organization and their relationship with development and maturation
======
Within curved epithelia, cells arrange differently to form structures and perform functions during development and maturation. These arrangements can be affected by geometry, biochemical tracers, as well as mechanical perturbations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of how local packing of cells is regulated to form these curved epithelial architectures is unclear. Furthermore, how packing evolves during growth, and whether this physical picture of how cells self-coordinate has any correlation with higher level biological functions such as maturation are totally unknown.
