Here are some projects that I am currently working on ðŸ’­ <br/>

## Collective curvature sensing in 3D multicellular systems
Most biological structures, such as alveoli, bronchi and intestines, are naturally curved in 3D. Even for inert materials, it is known that curvature fundamentally changes basic processes such as crystallization, yet it remains unclear to what extent the cellular collective responds to curvature.

## Cell packing and self-organization and their relationship with development and maturation
Within curved epithelia, cells arrange differently to form structures and perform functions during development and maturation. These arrangements can be affected by geometry, biochemical tracers, as well as mechanical perturbations. I am interested to know how packing evolves during growth, and whether this physical picture of how cells self-coordinate has any correlation with higher level biological functions such as maturation.

## Multicellular flow analysis in collective cell migration
We decompose the velocity field into divergence, curl, and shear to study the flow behaviors in living biological systems.

## Cell-matrix interaction during development and differentiation

## Temporal behavior in oscillary epithelia
Despite numerous studies on the spatial patterns of cell migration, the temporal dynamics have been largely overlooked. I am interested in studying oscillatory patterns and the corresponding "waves" within epithelia. Such temporal analysis provides a novel approach to examine higher-level biological functions, and can serve as a indicator for distinguishing healthy and diseased tissues.
