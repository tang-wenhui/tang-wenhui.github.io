About me
----
Contact: [wenhuit@mit.edu](wenhuit@mit.edu)

I am a postdoc fellow at Harvard Medical School, working with [Olivier Pourquié](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/olivier-pourquié-phd). I received my PhD degree from MIT [Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu) in May 2024, under the advise of [Ming Guo](https://www.guolab.mit.edu). My research uncovers the spatial and temporal organization in complex multicellular systems from the biophysics and mechanics perspectives, and how these physical principles apply in tissue engineering and developmental biology!
