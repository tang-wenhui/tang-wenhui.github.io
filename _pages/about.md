About me
----
Contact: [wenhuit@mit.edu](wenhuit@mit.edu)

I am currently a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering, MIT. My research focuses on spatiotemporal behaviors in 3D multicellular systems, and how these physical observations indicate higher level biological functions. My hobbies include photography, hiking, kayaking, cooking, and more to explore. This website gives a brief introduction about me ðŸ˜Š



Research Interests 
----
Right now I have a very broad research interests and it is still growing.
* If cells in 3D multicellular systems can sense the curvature they live on, and how?
* How cells organize themselves in 3D multicellular systems to perform certain functions(such as morphogensis and maturation)?
* Multicellular flow analysis in collective cell migration
* How cells interact with ECM during development and differentiation?
* Temporal behavior in oscillary epithelia
* Epithelia origami to mimic brain sulci
* Can neuron biophysical properties and collective talks indicate different cognitive functions?
