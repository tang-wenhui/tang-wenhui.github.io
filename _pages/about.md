About me
----
Contact: [wenhuit@mit.edu](wenhuit@mit.edu)

I am currently a PhD student at [Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu), MIT, working with Professor [Ming Guo](https://www.guolab.mit.edu). My research focuses on spatiotemporal behaviors in 3D multicellular systems, and how these physical observations indicate higher level biological functions. My hobbies include photography, hiking, kayaking, cooking, and more to explore. This website gives a brief introduction about me :)



I have broad research interests in biology, physics, and mechanics. And my motivation drives by my curiosity to science!
