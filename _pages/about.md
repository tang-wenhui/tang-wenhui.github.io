I am currently a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering, MIT. My research focuses on spatiotemporal behaviors in 3D multicellular systems, and how these physical observations indicate higher level biological functions. My hobbies include photography, hiking, kayaking, cooking, and more to explore. This website gives a brief introduction about me ðŸ˜Š



Research Interests 
----
* Collective curvature sensing in 3D multicellular systems
* Cell packing and self-organization and their relationship with development and maturation
* Multicellular flow analysis in collective cell migration
* Cell-matrix interaction during development and differentiation
* Temporal behavior in oscillary epithelia
