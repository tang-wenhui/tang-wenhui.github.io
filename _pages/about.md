About me
----
I am a second-year postdoc at Harvard Medical School, working with [Olivier Pourquié](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/olivier-pourquié-phd). I received my PhD degree from MIT [Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu) in May 2024, under the advise of [Ming Guo](https://www.guolab.mit.edu). My research uncovers the spatial and temporal organization in complex multicellular systems from the biophysics and mechanics perspectives, and how these physical principles apply in tissue engineering and developmental biology. Currently, I am investigating the mechanics of somite pattern formation, and uncovering the dynamics of segmentation clock synchronization at singel-cellular and multicellular level during human somitogenesis in vitro.
