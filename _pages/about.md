About me
----
Contact: [wenhuit@mit.edu](wenhuit@mit.edu)

I am currently a postdoc fellow at Harvard Medical School & Brigham and Women's Hospital, working with Professor [Olivier Pourquié](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/olivier-pourquié-phd). I received my PhD degree from MIT [Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu) in May 2024, under the advise of Professor [Ming Guo](https://www.guolab.mit.edu). My PhD research focuses on spatiotemporal behaviors in 3D multicellular systems, and how these physical observations indicate higher level biological functions.
