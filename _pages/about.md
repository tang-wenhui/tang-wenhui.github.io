I am currently a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering, MIT. My research focuses on spatiotemporal behaviors in 3D multicellular systems, and how these physical observations indicate higher level biological functions. This website gives a brief introduction to me.



Research Interests :bulb:
----
Collective curvature sensing in 3D multicellular systems
Cell packing and self-organization and their relationship with development and maturation
Multicellular flow analysis in collective cell migration
Cell-matrix interaction during development and differentiation
Temporal behavior in oscillary epithelia
